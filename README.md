## Overview

This repository contains the jupyter notebooks used for the first homework of the Artificial Neural Networks & Deep Learning course given by Professors Matteuci and Boracchi at Politecnico di Milano. 

The first homework consisted in an image classification task. The dataset contains pictures of leaves belonging to 14 different species and is characterized by a strong class imbalance. 

## CNN Model

To solve the task, we implemented a Convolutional Neural Network. The architecture of the model is shown below.
